                </h2>
                <p class="mb-0"><b>1. Improve Your Home’s Energy Efficiency<br></br></b>
                  There are many things you can do to help your house become more energy efficient. From installing weatherstripping and window coverings to help maintain the internal temperature to upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, there are large and small ways to save energy.<br></br>
                  <b>2. Buy Local<br></br></b>
                  The current food production system places an enormous strain on the environment. Shipping food all over the world requires immense quantities of fuel, not to mention the additional pollution and carbon emissions. You can help combat this by choosing locally-grown food as much as possible. Farmer’s markets, CSAs and co-ops are all great resources for local food.<br></br>
                  <b>3. Compost<br></br></b>
                  Choosing to compost waste instead of throwing it away offers many benefits. You can cut down on your home’s waste and landfill contributions. Compost also provides great fertilizer for a home garden. Creating a compost system is a much more natural and eco-friendly way to dispose of waste.<br></br>
                  <b>4. Conserve Water<br></br></b>
                  This may seem obvious, but there are still many people who unconsciously waste gallons of water every day. It can be lots of small daily things that add up over time: running the water while brushing your teeth, over-watering your lawn or not fixing a leaky faucet. Making the effort to conserve water greatly helps the environment and also keeps your monthly water bill low.<br></br>
                  <b>5. Choose Eco-Friendly Producers<br></br></b>
                  Consider how much power you have as a consumer. The more people choose to reward environmentally responsible companies with business and revenue, the more other companies will be encouraged to make eco-friendly choices. Supporting responsible companies also regulates supply and demand to make eco-friendly products more affordable.<br></br>
                  <b>6. Drive Less<br></br></b>
                  Fossil fuels greatly impact the environment and contribute to pollution and global warming. You can help the environment by driving less, and using more eco-friendly modes of transportation instead. Riding a bike or walking are excellent choices, and provide the extra bonus of helping you stay in shape. You can also choose public transportation. If your lifestyle requires lots of driving time, consider investing in a hybrid or electric car.<br></br>
                  <b>7. Learn from the Experts<br></br></b>
                  A great way to learn about environmentally-friendly companies and what you can do to support them is to conduct research and listen to experts in the industry. They help companies create sustainable and affordable agriculture products and provide valuable information related to the environment and environmental responsibility.<br></br>
                  <b>8. Recycle, Reuse, Repurpose<br></br></b>
                  Any time you can reuse or recycle an item instead of throwing it away it’s a small victory for the environment. Recycling is easier than ever with drop-off centers in most towns or the option to have your recycling picked up with your weekly trash service. There are countless ideas on the internet for ways to repurpose or reuse things. When you are ready to throw something in the trash, take a second first to think about if it can be recycled or reused. You may be surprised at how much you can reduce your household’s waste simply by taking a minute to consider other options.<br></br>
                  These are just a few tips on how you can positively support our environment, there are countless more options; but simply incorporating these actions in your everyday life could make a huge impact.
